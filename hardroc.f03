PROGRAM hardroc
! This is the program HARDRoC -- Hunting Asymptotic
! Relativistic Decay Rates of Clusters. The purpose of this
! program is, to read in xyz files of cluster structures,
! to calculate statistics of pair and triple parameters,
! read experimental parameters for the chosen systems and
! to calculate the partial and total decay rates of the cluster.
