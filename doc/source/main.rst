Welcome to HARDRoC's documentation!
===================================
HARDRoC -- Hunting Asymptotic Relativistic Decay Rates of Clusters -- is a program
to calculate decay widths of electronic decay processes such as ICD and
ETMD3 based on a structure, which has to be entered, and experimental parameters.

The equations used were derived in J. Chem. Phys. 138, 014305 (2013).
