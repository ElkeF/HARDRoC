Generated Output Files
======================

Main Output
-----------
One main output file is written to xyz-file plus an extension of ".out".


Kinetic energy spectra of ICD or ETMD electrons
-----------------------------------------------
Such data is written to ICD* an ETMD* respectively. Their names contain
the values of the total angular momenta and their projections, which
characterize the the channel. For each channel in the ICD or ETMD channel file
one such file is written.
