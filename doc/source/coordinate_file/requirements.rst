Coordinate File
===============

This file is expected to contain xyz coordinates of the structure
under investigation. It has to follow certain requirements:

  * The file contains nothing else than the atom types and coordinates.
  * Spaces in front of the atom types are not allowed.


Example
-------

A typical coordinate file would be::

  Ar    0.0000   -3.0670   0.0000
  Xe    0.0000    0.9330   0.0000
  Xe    5.0000    0.0000   0.0000

as to be found in the directory test_inputs
